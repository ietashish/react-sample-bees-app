# react-sample-bees-app
A React Sample Application used for SPA demos

# What does the app provide
1. The app is a single page application with multiple views. 
2. The following piece of code is already implemented in the app (inside `src/index.js`) which is responsible for triggering view.
```javascript
   if (typeof adobe != 'undefined' && adobe.target && typeof adobe.target.triggerView === 'function') {
            let viewName = window.location.hash;
            viewName = viewName.substring(2);

            console.log("Triggering view: " + viewName);
            adobe.target.triggerView(viewName);
    }
```
